# BACKTRACKING
## Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions related to backtracking. Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be a valid solution. I am using the Coder Army Sheet for these questions [Coder Army Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pud-vdSPhhljScynHvTUGRE5yxEV6dCMb45rOwoSt_Q/edit#gid=0).
